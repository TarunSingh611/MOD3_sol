                <h4>Speed</h4>
                <p>when you travel at speeds approaching the speed of light, time slows down for you relative to the outside world. It’s
                been measured Using twin atomic clocks (one flown in a jet aircraft, the other stationary on Earth) physicists have
                shown
                that a flying clock ticks slower, because of its speed.Time travel to the past is theoretically possible in certain
                general relativity spacetime geometries that permit traveling faster than the speed of light, such as cosmic strings,
                transversable wormholes, and Alcubierre drives.

                <h4 >Gravity</h4>
                <p>The next method is also inspired by Einstein. According to his theory of general relativity, the stronger the gravity
                you feel, the slower time moves. As you get closer to the centre of the Earth, for example, the strength of gravity
                increases. Time runs
                slower for your feet than your head.Gravitational time dilation occurs because objects with a lot of mass create a
                strong gravitational field. The gravitational field is really a curving of space and time. The stronger the gravity,
                the more spacetime curves, and the slower time itself proceeds.

                <h4 >Suspended animation</h4>
                <p>
                    Another way to travel to the future may be to slow your perception of time by slowing down, or stopping, your bodily
                    processes and then restarting them later. Bacterial spores and Some mammals can slow down their metabolism during
                    hibernation, dramatically
                    reducing their cells’ requirement. Suspended animation has been understood as the slowing or stopping of life processes
                    by exogenous or endogenous means without terminating life itself. Breathing, heartbeat and other involuntary functions
                    may still occur, but they can only be detected by artificial means.
